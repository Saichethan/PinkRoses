# Diagnostic Tests for Breast Cancer
Diagnosing the type and stage of breast cancer may require several techniques and different kinds of tests. Our doctors order the most appropriate diagnostic tests to find abnormal growths, determine if they are cancerous, and assess their type and aggressiveness.

### Noninvasive Breast Imaging Tests

* [Breast MRI](): Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a radiation-free way of capturing highly detailed images of the breast.

* [Breast ultrasound](): This technique, sometimes called sonography, uses high-frequency sound waves to generate digital images, which can provide further information on abnormalities detected during a mammography, MRI, or physical exam.

* [Digital mammography](): This now-standard digital imaging technique allows radiologists to detect and diagnose breast cancer earlier.

* [3-D mammography](): Also called tomosynthesis, 3-D mammography shows only a few layers of the breast at a time to detect cancer at a higher rate, with fewer false positive results. 


### Additional Tests for Breast Cancer

* [Breast cancer biopsy](): A radiologist or surgeon takes a tissue sample from the abnormal area in the breast for analysis by a pathologist. 

* [Bone scan](): This procedure uses radioactive dye to examine your bones for abnormalities, which may or may not be cancerous.

* [CT scan](): Computed tomography, sometimes called CAT scan, is noninvasive, sophisticated X-ray technology that can provide highly detailed images. Although many images are taken during a CT scan, you typically receive the same or less radiation exposure than with a single standard X-ray.

* [PET scan](): Positron emission tomography is a powerful test that can detect extremely small cancer tumors. A PET scan can tell your doctor whether a tumor is benign or malignant, potentially sparing you from diagnostic surgeries.
