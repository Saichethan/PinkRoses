## Overview

Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast multiply abnormally (mutate) to cause a tumor in the breast. Unlike noncancerous (benign) tumors, cancerous (malignant) tumors can spread to other parts of your body. The most common type of female breast cancer begins in the milk ducts and is called ductal carcinoma.

Over the past 15 years, medical experts have stopped viewing breast cancer as a single disease and now define it as a number of very distinct types. Invasive types of cancer can spread to other parts of the breast or body. We can often cure noninvasive and invasive types of cancer if we detect and treat them early. Regular mammograms and screenings can help women detect cancer earlier, for a greater chance of curing it.

Each type of breast cancer requires a different treatment approach. This is why getting an accurate diagnosis and the right treatment path for your specific breast cancer type is key to achieving the best outcome.
